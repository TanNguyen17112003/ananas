<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project üîé

![Main page](/Demo_image/index.png)

In this semester (HK232), my team has been assigned an Assignment requiring the designing of the interface and implementation of basic features for a company or business website. All members in the group reached a consensus and decided to choose Ananas website as a template. [refer here](https://ananas.vn/)

Here's why:
* We are young Vietnamese and we love shoes.
* We also find their news often updated, which have given us lots of data and save us time from creating ones,
* And the simplicity of their website LOL.

Of course, we have faced many difficulties during cloning the website, the flexibility really screwed us up and sometimes made us cry every single night. We, however, have managed to work harder and together and then, the problems were solved and this website was born. It is a great pleasant for us to present this project to you, hope you enjoy it and find it useful for your project too LOL.
